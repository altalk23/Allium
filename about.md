# Allium Drawing Tool

The drawing tool for Geometry Dash. Allows you to draw lines, curves, freeform, polygons, and more. It also supports adding your own custom text with a ttf font file.

Holding shift while drawing a line or polygon will snap the angle to 90 degrees, holding alt will snap to the grid.

You can use the cursor and move around using the arrow keys in the text editor.

You can hold space to temporarily disable the brush and pan around.

More features are planned! Fill tool, SVG import, and more.
